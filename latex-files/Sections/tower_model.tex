Because the tower height varied in this study, it was necessary to calculate the tower mass and perform structural analyses.
The structural analysis was used to constrain the tower from stress or buckling issues. 
It was necessary to provide a model with gradients for all of our constraints, which included the von Mises stress, shell buckling, and global buckling at any point along the tower; the tower taper ratio; and the first natural frequency of the structure. The method by which these calculations were made is discussed in more detail in our previous study \citep{stanley2018}.
