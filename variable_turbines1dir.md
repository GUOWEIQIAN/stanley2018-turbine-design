One area that our lab specializes in is wind farm optimization, or using algorithms and computer models to design better wind farms. Wind turbines remove momentum from the air as it passes by, leaving a region of slow moving air behind them (known as a wake). In a wind farm, power production can suffer if the turbines are built in poor locations that are heavily waked. In the past, this has been accounted for with layout optimization (finding the best locations to build the wind turbines to maximize power production) and active turbine control (decreasing the power production of some individual turbines to leave momentum in the wind and benefit the farm as a whole).

Over the past few years we have been researching a third way to decrease turbine waking and increase power production: designing the wind turbines and the wind farm at the same time. Currently wind turbines and wind farms are designed sequentially, meaning a wind turbine is designed for some wind conditions, then that turbine is used throughout an entire wind farm. In our paper that was just recently published, we found that the cost of energy in a wind farm can be significantly decreased by optimizing the wind turbine design at the same time as the wind farm layout. Furthermore, we found that if we didn't force all of the turbines to be exactly the same we could reduce the cost to produce energy even further. In many cases, it is better for some turbines to be tall with large rotors, and for some turbines to be short with smaller rotors. Because the turbines were allowed to change their relative height and rotor size, we were able to reduce turbine waking further than what can be accomplished by just optimizing turbine location. Our results indicate that there can be significant benefits to building wind farms with different turbine designs. For wind farms with closely spaced with turbines, a wind farm with different turbine designs can have a cost of energy that is 7-10% lower than the same wind farm optimized with all the same turbines. 

In this study, we created and combined several computer models to represent an entire wind farm. We modeled the farm power production, the individual wind turbine and farm costs, the forces on the turbine towers, and a surrogate of the forces on the turbine rotors. A surrogate means that we fit a two dimensional surface to data from a complex structural model in order to calculate it faster. We considered wind speed variation with height caused by friction with the ground, wind direction distributions from real wind data, and variations in the wind speed at every wind direction. We also calculated exact analytic gradients for every portion of the simulation to allow for good convergence of the many design variables during optimization. 

The animation above shows an accelerated example of one optimization from our paper. In this example, you can see the first 100 iterations reducing the cost of energy in the wind farm as much as possible. There are two different groups of turbines, and you can clearly see the turbine locations (shown in the top left) and the heights and rotor diamters (shown in the top middle) changing at the same time. What isn't seen in this example is that the tower diameter and thickness, turbine rating, and blade chord and twist distributions were also design variables. The bottom left frame shows the wind direction probabalities that were used for this example, and the bottom middle frame shows the power that the wind farm produces for each incoming wind direction. As the turbine designs and locations change throughout the optimization, this direction power production also change. Notice that near the end of the optimization, there is high power production from all of the wind The figures on the far right show the cost of energy (on the top), and annual energy production (on the bottom) of the wind farm throughout the optimization. The best wind farm produces more energy, for a cheaper cost per MWh than the starting farm.
