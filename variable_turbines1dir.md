# Coupled Wind Turbine Design and Layout Optimization
![Alt Text](lay.gif)

BYU researchers have discovered that wind farms can be significantly improved by desigining wind turbines and the wind farms where they will operate at the same time! Specifically, there are many situations where having different wind turbine designs in the same farm results in higher energy production and lower cost of energy. Because of the difference in turbine height and rotor diameter, turbines in one group have minimal interactions with the turbines from the other group. 

The animation above shows the an example of the optimization process used in this research. This simple optimization used the assumption that the wind always came from due north. As shown, the turbine positions, heights, and rotor diameters are all modified at the same time. What isn't seen in this example is that the tower diameter and thickness, turbine rating, and blade chord and twist distributions are also design variables.
