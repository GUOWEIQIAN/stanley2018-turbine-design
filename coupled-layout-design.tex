\begin{abstract}
In this study, wind farms are optimized to show the benefit of coupling turbine design and layout optimization, as well as including different turbine designs in a single wind farm. For our purposes, turbine design includes hub height, rotor diameter, rated power, and tower design. A 32-turbine wind farm and a 60-turbine wind farm are both considered, as well as a variety of turbine spacings and wind shear exponents. The wind turbines are modeled structurally, and structural constraints as well as turbine costs are considered in the optimization. Results indicate that coupled turbine design and layout optimization is superior to sequentially optimizing turbine design, then turbine layout. Coupled optimization results in an additional  2--5\% reduction in cost of energy compared to optimizing sequentially. Furthermore, wind farms with closely spaced wind turbines can greatly benefit from non-uniform turbine design throughout the farm. Some of these wind farms with heterogeneous turbine design have an additional 10\% cost of energy reduction compared to wind farms with identical turbines throughout the farm.

%\appendix
%\section{}    %% Appendix A

%\subsection{}     %% Appendix A1, A2, etc.


%\noappendix       %% use this to mark the end of the appendix section

%% Regarding figures and tables in appendices, the following two options are possible depending on your general handling of figures and tables in the manuscript environment:

%% Option 1: If you sorted all figures and tables into the sections of the text, please also sort the appendix figures and appendix tables into the respective appendix sections.
%% They will be correctly named automatically.

%% Option 2: If you put all figures after the reference list, please insert appendix tables and figures after the normal tables and figures.
%% To rename them correctly to A1, A2, etc., please add the following commands in front of them:

%\appendixfigures  %% needs to be added in front of appendix figures

%\appendixtables   %% needs to be added in front of appendix tables

%% Please add \clearpage between each table and/or figure. Further guidelines on figures and tables can be found below.
